# Bookify: Spotify & OpenLibrary API Mashup
Bookify is an interactive web application that uses the Spotify Web API and Open Library APIs (Search API and Covers API) to recommend you books based on your top 10 artists's music genres. This app is intended for users who are overwhelemed by the decision process involved with choosing a book to read but use Spotify regularly.

This project uses a SECRET_KEY for Flask session management. Although it is not an API key, it is needed to run our code. To run the app locally, create a keys.py file and add the line: "SECRET_KEY="insert your key here". Add keys.py to .gitignore.
